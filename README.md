# MediTrack for Kids
A hackathon project to track kids medication and reward them with Kaia tokens.

## About
Approximately 6% of the global population uses cryptocurrencies. What about the rest? What happens to older adults using crypto? And what about kids?

In the search for answers, new blockchains have emerged, often referred to as layer 2 solutions, aimed at addressing the shortcomings of existing layer 1 technologies. However, these advancements did not effectively onboard new users; they often turned out to be just another way to scam people.

So, what is the key to the critical question in the cryptocurrency space? How do we successfully onboard new users?

The answer lies in creating simple technologies that genuinely meet people's needs, technologies that help solve everyday problems. We don’t need complex systems anymore, we need straightforward solutions that enhance the daily lives of families. This is why I developed MediTrack, a useful tool for tracking the treatment of a child undergoing medication. 

## Problem statement 

Many children struggle with adhering to medication schedules, leading to inconsistent treatment and health risks, especially for chronic conditions. Parents face challenges in tracking doses, motivating kids, and ensuring compliance, while traditional methods like paper logs or reminders often lack engagement and real-time oversight. This gap results in missed doses, frustration, and potential medical setbacks, particularly in busy households or for kids who find medication routines unexciting. We aim to address this by creating MediTrack for Kids, a digital solution that simplifies tracking, gamifies the process with crypto rewards, and empowers parents with a seamless, engaging way to ensure their children’s health.
