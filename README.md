# MediTrack for Kids
A hackathon project to track kids medication and reward them with Kaia tokens.

## About
Approximately 6% of the global population uses cryptocurrencies. What about the rest? What happens to older adults using crypto? And what about kids?

In the search for answers, new blockchains have emerged, often referred to as layer 2 solutions, aimed at addressing the shortcomings of existing layer 1 technologies. However, these advancements did not effectively onboard new users; they often turned out to be just another way to scam people.

So, what is the key to the critical question in the cryptocurrency space? How do we successfully onboard new users?

The answer lies in creating simple technologies that genuinely meet people's needs, technologies that help solve everyday problems. We donâ€™t need complex systems anymore, we need straightforward solutions that enhance the daily lives of families. This is why I developed MediTrack, a useful tool for tracking the treatment of a child undergoing medication.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/west-XE/MediTrack`

3. Connect MetaMask for rewards.
